# Shop-vue

### How cart works

- Products can be added to the cart if they have an item available on stock.
- Products added to the cart must be removable.
- Checkout must be disabled if cart **total** is over user **limit**.
- If a product already exists on the cart, its counter should be updated.
- All products have a shipping price. **shipping** is defined by the highest shipping price of products added to cart.

### How promotions work

- 30% OFF should reduce 30% of the costs on **subtotal**.
- $100.00 Discount should reduce $100.00 of **total**.
- Free Shipping should set **shipping** to zero.
- +$100.00 on limit should increase user **limit** by $100.00.
